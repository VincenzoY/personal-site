        <h1>A little bit about me.</h1>
        <p>I'm a graduate of Dr. E P Scarlett High School; where I took Advanced Placement courses 
        and acheived the Advanced Placement Scholar with Distinction. Currently, I am a first year student at 
        the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science. 
        <br><br>
        I enjoy making useful things! I like to use code to solve tangible problems and create satisfying solutions.
        <br><br>
        On a more personal note, some of my hobbies are playing video games, drawing and fencing. I also enjoy drinking some hot green tea on 
        cold days (Fun Fact: green tea is the color theme for this site)</p>

        <h1>Some of my skills</h1>
        <p>I'm learning back-end development using the Ruby language and the Ruby on Rails framework. For the front-end, I use HTML, SASS and Javascript. 
        In fact, this site was built using these skills I have learned. 
        One of my next goals is to get better at Javascript and learn a JS framework.
        <br><br>
        I have also learned Python. I have not built any projects with it yet but it has become my main language for solving coding problems</p>
