        <h1>A little bit about me.</h1>
        <p>I'm a graduate of Dr. E P Scarlett High School; where I took Advanced Placement courses 
        and acheived the Advanced Placement Scholar with Distinction. I also took the SAT in 2020 and acheived a superscore of 1560/1600. 
        Currently, I am a first year student at 
        the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science. 
        <br><br>
        I enjoy making useful things! I like to use code to solve tangible problems and create satisfying solutions.
        <br><br>
        On a more personal note, some of my hobbies are playing video games, drawing and fencing. I also enjoy drinking some hot green tea on 
        cold days (Fun Fact: green tea is the color theme for this site)</p>
